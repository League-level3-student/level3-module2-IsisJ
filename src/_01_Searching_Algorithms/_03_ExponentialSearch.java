		//4. make while loop that checks for two conditions:
		//    	counter is less than the length of the array,
		//		and the array element at counter is less than or equal to value
		
			//5. inside the while loop, double the value of counter.

		//6. create an integer called minimum
		
		//7. if counter is less than the length of the array,
		//   set minimum equal to counter
		
		//8. otherwise, set minimum equal to the length of the array minus 1.
	
		//9. use the binary search method you wrote using the following parameters:
		//		the array to be searched
		//		half of the counter
		//		minimum
		//		the value to be found
