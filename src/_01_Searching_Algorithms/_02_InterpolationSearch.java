		//   initialize them to 0 and the length of the array minus one

        //   start is less than or equal to end
        //   value is greater than or equal to the array element at start
        //   value is less than or equal to the array element at end

			//4. create an integer called position
        	//  initialize it to the following:
        	//  start + (((end - start) / (array[end] - array[start])) * (value - array[start]));
        	//  This calculates the center of the array keeping the even distribution in mind.
      
            //5. if the array element at position is equal to the value,
            //   then we found it and can return position.
      
            //6. if the array element at position is less than value,
            //   then set start equal to position plus one
            
            //7. otherwise, set end equal to position minus one
          
        //8. Return -1 because the value was not found
